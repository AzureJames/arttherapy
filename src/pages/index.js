with.

					<p className='off-white m-w65'  style={{ marginBottom: '2rem'}}>
					While your experience is unique, please allow us to share our expertise in
areas such as trauma, emotional regulation, anxiety, depression, grief and loss, life transitions,
substance use and substance use in the family. If you are someone who has been interested in
reconnecting with your body or soul this is very likely the place to

					<h2 style={{ fontSize: '29px'}}>About Us</h2>
					<p className='off-white m-w65'  style={{ marginBottom: '2rem'}}>
					Life is Art is an unique Art Therapy Studio space, where Art Therapy, EMDR
and a holistic wellness approach to therapy are all combined. Meditation,
Mindfulness, Reiki and Aromatherapy are often included in sessions. Art
Therapy gives a non-verbal means for expression when words are not
enough. EMDR allows a process of resolving traumas both large and small. This is a safe and
inviting atmosphere where trauma can be addressed and healing is possible. In person and
telehealth appointments are available. Self-Pay fee and some insurances are accepted.
